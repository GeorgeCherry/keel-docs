## Advanced Tutorial

Keel provides developers with an instant fullstack API that they can use to power their applications with zero stress. It abstracts away a huge chunk of the difficulties that come with building fullstack applications with Low code.

With Keel, developers can define an API with models and define various operations that can be performed on the API.

In this tutorial, we will build the backend of a [SaaS app](https://saas-starter-ui.vercel.app/) with Keel.

Weâ€™ll cover the following:

- how to use Keel to create complex models for your data,
- create an API with full-fledged authentication capabilities,
- use secrets to manage sensitive credentials, and
- how to write custom functions for your APIs.
