# Generated API client

As well as using the APIs directly, you can generated a typescript client for your frontend projects to easily work with your APIs with full end to end type safety


import { Callout } from "nextra/components";

<Callout>
Requires version **0.351.0** or higher of the CLI
</Callout>

## Generating the client

To generate the client, use the `client` command in the CLI from within a Keel project

```bash
 keel client
```

This will generate a single file with zero dependancies in your current directory.

To output the client directly into your frontend project you can either pass an output path

```bash
keel client --output ../myFrontend/src
```

or by running the CLI from your frontend project and referencing the Keel directory

```bash
keel client -d ../myKeelApp
```

This will generate a client for the first API in your project. If you have multiple APIs you can specify which API to generate for with the `-a apiName` flag 

<Callout type="info">
This client uses fetch so will only work in environments where fetch is available
</Callout>

## Using the client

First, import `APIClient` from the generated file and create a new instance with the deployed url of your project (or the [localhost](http://localhost) address if running locally)

**N.B.** This endpoint url should include the API name path but not the protocol (e.g. json/rpc/gql)

```ts
import { APIClient } from "../keelClient";

const client = new APIClient({
  endpoint: "https://myproject.keelapps.xyz/web/",
});
```

### Authenticating

If your API requires authentication, use the `authenticate` action as normal and then store the returned token to be used for subsequent requests

```tsx
const auth = await client.authenticate({
  emailPassword: {
    email: "me@keel.xyz",
    password: "topsecret",
  },
  createIfNotExists: true,
});

if (auth.error) {
  console.log("Auth failed", auth.error.type);
  return;
}

client._setToken(auth.data.token);

console.log("Authenticated");
```

On logout remember to clear the token

```tsx
client._clearToken();
```

### Error handling

The response of an action is a promise that resolves to an object that either contains the data or an error object

```tsx
type Data<T> = {
  data: T;
  error?: never;
};

type Error = {
  data?: never;
  error: ErrorObj ;
};

type ErrorObj = {
  type: "forbidden" | "not_found" | "internal_server_error" | "unknown" | "unauthorized" | "bad_request";
  message: string;
  requestId?: string; // can be used to access traces in the console
};
```

You can then check the presence of the error object to handle any errors 

```tsx
const myAction = await client.myAction({
  input: "foo"
});

if (myAction.error) {
  console.log("Failed", myAction.error.type);
  return; 
}

const { data } = myAction

// Do things with the data 
```
