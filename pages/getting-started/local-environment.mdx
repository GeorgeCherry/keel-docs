# Local environment setup

You can run your Keel project locally with our CLI.

## Dependenies

To run your Keel app locally you need both Node.js and Docker installed.

### Node.js
Node.js is used for running your functions and tests. We require Node version 18 or higher.

* [Download installer](https://nodejs.org/en/download)
* [nvm (Node.js version manager)](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)
* [Brew](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/node)

### Docker
Docker is used to run a local Postgres database. We only require that Docker is installed and running, you don't need to configure it in any way.

* [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/)

## Installing the Keel CLI

### Mac

On a Mac the Keel CLI can be installed using Homebrew.

```bash
$ brew tap teamkeel/homebrew-keel
$ brew install keel
```

### Checking the installation

After installing you should be able to run `keel version` in your terminal and see something like this then the CLI is installed correctly.

```bash
$ keel version
v0.313.2
```

## VSCode Extension

We have made a VSCode extension that provides inline validation, formatting, and syntax highlighting for Keel schema files. You can find the extension by searching for “Keel” in the Extensions tab in VSCode.
