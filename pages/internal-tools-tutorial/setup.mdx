# Setup

<Callout type="info" emoji="ðŸ’¡">
  Create a [new blank project](https://console.keel.so/start?type=blank) in your Keel Console. Once you deploy a schema, you will be able to access internal tools in the **Operate** section of the sidebar.
</Callout>

## Basic models

### Product

Let's first create a `Product` for which we want to manage stock. We'll give it a name, an optional description and an optional image URL.
```keel {1-7}
model Product {
    fields {
        name Text
        description Text?
        imageUrl Text?
    }
}
```

### StockItem

Since we want to track how many products we have in stock, let's create a `StockItem` with a quantity field and a relationship to the `Product` (a product can have many stock items).
```keel {4,7-12}
model Product {
    fields {
        ...
        stock StockItem[]
    }
}
model StockItem {
    fields {
        product Product
        quantity Number
    }
}
```

### StockLocation

And lastly, we want to know where the stock is located. Let's create a `StockLocation` with an identifiable name and a relationship to `StockItem` (a location can keep many items).
```keel {4, 7-12}
model StockItem {
    fields {
        ...
        location StockLocation
    }
}

model StockLocation {
    fields {
        name Text @unique
        items StockItem[]
    }
}
```

## Schema 

```keel filename="schema.keel" {1-23}
model Product {
    fields {
        name Text
        description Text?
        imageUrl Text?
        stock StockItem[]
    }
}

model StockItem {
    fields {
        product Product
        quantity Number
        location StockLocation
    }
}

model StockLocation {
    fields {
        name Text @unique
        items StockItem[]
    }
}
```

## Preview tools

<Callout type="info" emoji="ðŸ’¡">
  Deploy your schema to generate internal tools in the [Keel Console](https://console.keel.so)
</Callout>

 If you navigate to `All tools` in the Console, you see that, apart from the built-in `Identity` tools, we haven't created any custom tools yet, because we haven't added any actions.
