# Internal tools

Internal tools give you a simple and secure user interface to interact with your data. Building them requires no extra effort, as they are automatically generated from [APIs](/apis) that Keel creates and exposes from your schema. And because they are generated you get the great Keel user experience out-of-the-box.

import { Callout } from "nextra/components";

<Callout type="info" emoji="⚒️">
  A tool is an [action](/actions) that can be accessed and run via the [Keel Console](https://console.keel.so)
</Callout>

## Directory

The default API and each [additional one](/tutorial#apis) will create their own directory of tools. You can access the directory (or directories) in the **Operate** section of the [Keel Console](https://console.keel.so).

## Tool
Keel creates a page with a route for each action in the schema. This 'tool' then allows a user to:
1. Enter any inputs to the action
2. Run the action
3. Render the response
4. Navigate to related actions (with pre-populated inputs)

By defining a collection of actions of [all types](/actions#action-types) you assemble a UI optimised for efficient data manipulation and navigation through a unique flow of actions.

### Model list page
A model with a `list` action creates a page that lists entries for that model. If this action has inputs, it generates an inputs panel with a form that (re-)runs the action.
```keel
model Book {
    actions {
        // get getBook(id)
        list listBooks()
        // list listClassicBooks(...)
        // create createBook() with (...)
    }
}
```
<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
    A `get` action creates a link to listed entries
  {/* (the first in the list of actions of the same model) */}
</Callout>
<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
    Additional `list` actions create a dropdown menu to switch between them 
</Callout>
<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
    `create` actions create a button with links
</Callout>
<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  Enables shortcuts for navigating via model name in the directory
</Callout>

### Single entry page
A model with a `get` action creates a page that renders a single entry. If action has inputs, it generates an inputs panel with a form that (re-)runs the action.
```keel
model Book {
    actions {
        get getBook(id)
        // update updateBook(id) with (...)
        // delete deleteBook(id)
    }
}
```
<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
    Additional `get` actions create a dropdown menu to switch between them 
</Callout>
<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  `update` and `delete` actions with `id` as input create a link and pre-populate the input
</Callout>
<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  A `list` action creates a link to the Model list page
</Callout>

### Mutation pages
A model with a `create`/`update`/`delete` action creates a page that renders a form with inputs to the action. Submitting the form runs the action and displays the response.
```keel
model Book {
    fields {
        name Text
    }
    actions {
        create createBook() with (name)
        update updateBook() with (name)
        delete deleteBook(id)
    }
}
```


{/* 
`read` & `write`? */}

### Relationships
<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  Related model with a `get` or a `list` action with original model `id` as input creates a link from pages of the original model.
</Callout>

#### One to one
```keel
model Book {
    fields {
        author Author
    }
    actions {
        ...
    }
}

model Author {
    fields {
        book Book @unique
    }
    actions {
        // enables link to Author on Book action pages
        get getAuthor(book.id)
        // list listAuthors(book.id) if not @unique?
    }
}
```
#### One to many
```keel
model Book {
    fields {
        author Author
    }
    actions {
        // enables link to Book on Author action pages
        list listBooks(author.id)
    }
}

model Author {
    fields {
        books Book[]
    }
    actions {
        // actions
    }
}
```

#### Many to many
```keel
model Book {
    fields {
        author BookAuthor[]
    }
    actions {
        // enables link to Book on BookAuthor action pages
        list listBooks(author.id)
    }
}

model BookAuthor {
    fields {
        book Book @unique
        author Author @unique
    }
    actions {
        ...
    }
}

model Author {
    fields {
        books Book[]
    }
    actions {
        // enables link to Author on BookAuthor action pages
        list listAuthors(book.id)
    }
}
```

## Nested inputs
Support for nested inputs, such as [nested create](/actions#creating-nested-records)

## Lookup fields
Some inputs require the user to enter a unique entry. This is usually an `id` field relating to a specific model entry. By creating a `list` action for that model, you can generate a shortcut for the user to lookup that entry, so that they don't need to type in the value manually.

```keel
model Author {
    fields: {
        title Text
    }
    actions: {
        create createAuthor() with (title)

        // enables lookup on Author mutation pages
        list listBooks()
    }
}

```

```keel
model Author {
    fields {
        book Book
    }
    actions {
        create createAuthor() with (book)
    }
}
model Book {
    fields {
        author Author
    }
    actions {
        // enables lookup on createAuthor
        list listBooks()
    }
}
```

## Order
Internal tools consider the order of fields and actions in the model and will render them accordingly. They assume a descending order from most to least important.

Does it respect order of inputs? How do they work together?




## Permissions
Since internal tools just tap into the APIs, they respect the [permission](/permissions) logic from the schema and provide the context of the [Identity](/identity) logged into the Console. This way you have complete control over who has access to which actions.
