# Internal tools

Internal tools give you a simple and secure user interface to interact with your data. Building them requires no extra effort, as they are automatically generated from [APIs](/apis) that Keel creates and exposes from your schema. And because they are generated you get the great Keel user experience out-of-the-box.

<Callout type="info" emoji="⚒️">
  A tool is an [action](/actions) that can be accessed and run via the [Keel Console](https://console.keel.so)
</Callout>

## Directory

The default API and each [additional one](/tutorial#apis) will create their own directory of tools. You can access the directory (or directories) in the **Operate** section of the [Keel Console](https://console.keel.so).

## Tool
Keel creates a page with a route for each action in the schema. This 'tool' then allows a user to:
1. Enter any inputs to the action
2. Run the action
3. Render the response
4. Navigate to related actions (with pre-populated inputs)

By defining a collection of actions of [all types](/actions#action-types) you assemble a UI optimised for efficient data manipulation and navigation through a unique flow of actions.

### Toolbar
Each tool may have [additional actions](/internal-tools/linked-actions) that are automatically linked for you. You will also see more options here, such as an option to favourite the tool so that it stays in the sidebar for easy access, and open the action in the API explorer, which will show you examples of the types of API endpoints you can use in your own apps.

### Input field options
For actions that have inputs, the input field components have been configured to match the input type you have written in your schema. 
- If a field is optional, a `null` button will be displayed within that input field. Clicking this will set the field to null.
- Once an input field has a value, but you use the clear button to completely unset the field.
- For boolean fields, a yes/no toggle button will appear. You can set these to null if your field type is optional or clear the field and leave it unset if your input field is optional.
- For repeated fields as inputs, you will be add multiple items entries on the form.
- For id inputs, you may have a lookup button to help find an id so you don't have to type in the value manually. See [here](/internal-tools/lookups) for more details.

## Order
Internal tools consider the order of fields and actions in the model and will render them accordingly. They assume a descending order from most to least important.

## Permissions
Since internal tools just tap into the APIs, they respect the [permission](/permissions) logic from the schema and provide the context of the [Identity](/identity) logged into the Console. This way you have complete control over who has access to which actions.
