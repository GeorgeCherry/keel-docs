# Lookup fields
Some inputs require the user to enter a unique entry. This is usually an `id` field relating to a specific model entry. By creating a `list` action for that model, you can generate a shortcut for the user to lookup that entry, so that they don't need to type in the value manually.

```keel
model Author {
    fields: {
        title Text
    }
    actions: {
        create createAuthor() with (title)

        // enables lookup on Author mutation pages
        list listBooks()
    }
}
```

```keel
model Author {
    fields {
        book Book
    }
    actions {
        create createAuthor() with (book)
    }
}
model Book {
    fields {
        author Author
    }
    actions {
        // enables lookup on createAuthor
        list listBooks()
    }
}
```
