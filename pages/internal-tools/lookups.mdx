# Lookup fields
Some inputs require the user to enter a unique entry. This is usually an `id` field relating to a specific model entry. By creating a `list` action for that model, you can generate a shortcut for the user to lookup that entry on the id input field, so that they don't need to type in the value manually.

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  The lookup button defaults to using a list action on the other model that doesn't have any required inputs. This is so that all possible fields are displayed on default.
  If no list actions without required fields exists in your schema, it will use the first list action it can find.
</Callout>

Clicking on a lookup button will open the list action view in a modal. Clicking on a row entry result will fill the id input for you.  

Here is an example of a Keel schema with list actions that enable the lookup button on id input fields:
```keel
model Author {
    fields: {
        title Text
    }
    actions: {
        create createAuthor() with (title)

        // enables lookup on Author mutation pages
        list listBooks()
    }
}
```

```keel
model Author {
    fields {
        book Book
    }
    actions {
        create createAuthor() with (book)
    }
}
model Book {
    fields {
        author Author
    }
    actions {
        // enables lookup on createAuthor
        list listBooks()
    }
}
```
