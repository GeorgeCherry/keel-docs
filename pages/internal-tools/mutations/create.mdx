# Create actions

A model with a `create` action creates a page that renders a form with all the inputs for this action. Submitting the form runs the action and displays the response.

An example of a Keel schema model with a create action, which has required, optional and repeated fields.
```keel
model Order {
     fields {
        status OrderStatus? {
            @default(OrderStatus.New)
        }
        deliveryAddress Text
        customer Customer
        items OrderItem[]
    }

    actions {
        create createOrder() with (
          status,
          deliveryAddress,
          customer.id,
          items.product.id?,
          items.quantity?,
        )
    }
}
```

## Request
Input fields for the inputs provided in the schema will be rendered. Read more about input fields [here](/internal-tools#input-field-options)
If you have repeated fields as inputs, you will be add multiple items entries on the form. This includes creating [nested records](/actions#creating-nested-records).

## Response
Once you submit the form, the newly created entry and all of its fields will be displayed.

## Extras
A button to create another entry will be rendered in the toolbar.
