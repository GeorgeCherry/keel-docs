# Delete actions

A model with a `delete` action creates a page that renders a form with the unique input that you provided in the schema. 

An example of a Keel schema model with a delete action.
```keel
model Order {
    actions {
      delete deleteOrder(id)
    }
}
```

## Request
For `id` input fields, if the model has a relevant list action, you will see a "lookup" action button within the input field to help you quickly find the correct entry. Learn more [here](/internal-tools/lookups)

## Response
Displays whether the deletion was successful or not.

## Extras
A button to delete another entry will be rendered in the toolbar.
