# Update actions

A model with a `update` action creates a page that renders a form with all the inputs for this action. Submitting the form runs the action and displays the response.

An example of a Keel schema model with an update action.
```keel
model Order {
    fields {
      status OrderStatus? {
          @default(OrderStatus.New)
      }
      deliveryAddress Text
      customer Customer
      payments Payment[]
      items OrderItem[]
    }

    actions {
      update updateOrder(id) with (
        status,
        deliveryAddress,
        customer.id,
        payments.id,
        items.id,
      )
    }
}
```

## Request
Input fields for the inputs provided in the schema will be rendered. Read more about input fields [here](/internal-tools#input-field-options).

## Response
Once you submit the form, the newly created entry and all of its fields will be displayed.

## Extras
A button to update another entry will be rendered in the toolbar.
