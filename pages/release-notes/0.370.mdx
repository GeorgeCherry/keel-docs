## Version

0.370

## Features

### Watch mode for client generation

We have added a watch mode to the `keel client` generation command using the `--watch` flag.  Run `keel client --watch` to generate your [Keel Client](https://docs.keel.so/keel-auth-with-nextjs/building-the-backend#generating-the-keel-client) in real time.

This will continuously watch for changes to your Keel schema files and subsequently regenerate the client code when changes are made.

### Looking up models with composite keys

[Composite unique fields}(https://docs.keel.so/models#composite-unique-fields) can now be used as inputs for `get`, `update` and `delete` actions. This provides a lot of convenience when you already have your own "real-world" unique identifiers for models and don't necessary always need or want to look up by `id`.

Take the following example below where we update a `Product` by looking up using its composite unique fields.

```keel
model Product {
    fields {
        name Text
        supplierCode Text
        supplierSku Text
    }

    @unique([supplierSku, supplierCode])

    actions {
        update updateProduct(supplierSku, supplierCode) with (name)
    }
}
```

### Looking up models using relationships

We have further extended the `get`, `update`, and `delete` actions to support a smart way to look up models using relationships.  Let's amend the example schema above to demonstrate this.

```keel
model Supplier {
    fields {
        code @unique
    }
}
model Product {
    fields {
        name Text
        supplierCode Text
        supplierSku Text
    }

    @unique([supplierSku, supplier])

    actions {
        update updateProduct(supplierSku, supplier.code) with (name)
    }
}
```

## Fixes and Improvements

 - `keel init` will now generate files in non-empty directories, but won't overwrite any existing files.
 - A faster experience when running `keel geneate` as we now only pull NPM dependencies when we really need to.
 - `keel generate` will politely amend, rather than overwrite, the `tsconfig.json` file if it already exists.
 - General improvements to how we pipe output to the terminal when running `keel test` and `keel generate`.
