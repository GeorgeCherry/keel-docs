# 15 November, 2023

These changes have been released with version `0.372` of the CLI.

## Improvements to Function Hooks
​
We’ve made some improvements and bug fixes to the way function hooks work and also updated the [docs](/functions) page, but here is a summary of the changes:
​
* All hooks are now typed so they can be async / return Promises
* `beforeQuery` in an `update` function can now return a query builder
* `beforeWrite` in an `update` function now receives the _current_ record as a fourth argument
* `beforeWrite` is now called for `delete` functions
* Both `beforeWrite` and `afterWrite` for `delete` functions are passed the record that is being deleted as the third argument, rather than just the id
​
### Using non-model inputs

Another thing that is now fully supported is using non-model inputs in functions. An example of this would be something like:
​
```keel
model Film {
  fields {
    title Text
    releaseDate Date?
  }
  actions {
    list searchFilms(title, unreleased: Boolean?) @function
  }
}
```
​
In this schema the `searchThings` action accepts `title` which is a model field and `unreleased` which is **not a model field** and is explicitly typed as an optional boolean. The default query that is generated for this function will handle the `title` input automatically but will do nothing with the `unreleased` input - that is for you to handle in your function. For example:
​
```ts
export default SearchThings({
  beforeQuery(ctx, inputs, query) {
    if (inputs.unreleased) {
      return query.where({
        releaseDate: {
          equals: null,
        },
      })
    }
​
    return query;
  }
});
```
​
Non-model inputs can use any basic type - `Text`, `Boolean`, `Number`, `Date`, and `Timestamp` as well as enums.
