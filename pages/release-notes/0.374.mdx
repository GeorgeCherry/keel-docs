# 18 December, 2023

These changes have been released with version `0.374` of the CLI.

## Starting a new project with `keel init`

The `keel init` command guides you through setting up a new project from scratch. It also supports templates, which means you can get started with a working Keel schema and functions.

These starter templates can be found at [https://github.com/teamkeel/starter-templates](https://github.com/teamkeel/starter-templates). We only support one template for the moment.

## Support for nested creates in functions

This change means that model inputs for relationships work in `create` functions (as in, they are handled automatically for you).

Given this schema (permissions omitted)
```
model Author {
  fields {
    name Text
    books Book[]
  }
  actions {
    create createAuthor(name, books.title) @function
  }
}

model Book {
  fields {
    author Author
    title Text
  }
}
```

And this API request.
```jsonc
// POST /api/json/createAuthor
{
  "name": "Emily Bronte",
  "books": [
    {
      "title": "Wuthering Heights"
    }
  ]
}
```

An author record would be created with a linked book record!

## Fixes and Improvements

We've also released [a bunch of fixes and improvements](https://github.com/teamkeel/keel/releases/tag/v0.374.0) to our CLI and to our VS Code extension.
